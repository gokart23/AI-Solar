## Solar energy prediction using weather data

We intend to predict solar energy based on data from five cities:
Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati and Mumbai.

### Data

We used NREL database which can be accessed [here](https://maps.nrel.gov/nsrdb-viewer/#/?aL=UdPEX9%255Bv%255D%3Dt%268VWYIh%255Bv%255D%3Dt%268VWYIh%255Bd%255D%3D1&bL=groad&cE=0&lR=0&mC=21.820707853875017%2C92.28515625&zL=4).
To download,  select 'Point' under 'Download Data' section and put
a marker on required city in the map. We used data of all features from
2000-14.

### Configuration

In config.py, one can specify paths to data for different cities.
